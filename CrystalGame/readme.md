this is the prototype for a text based game based on steven universe. i will be using OOP for this project.

##goals:##
    -gem class with some gem object instances in the file gems.py  (implemented but needs some work) 
    
    -weapon class (whip, spear, sword, etc) with a subclass for the gem that weilds it (for example amethyst has a whip with 
    slashing damage, holy blue agate has an electric whip)
    (to be implemented...) 

    -fusion class, a way to save the fusion to the game state and remove component objects until fusion is defeated, then append the components back.
    (to be implemented...) 
    
    add method to unfuse gems, with a method to fuse weapons from a predetermined list as well
    (to be implemented...) 


    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    DISCLAIMER: i do not own nor am i affiliated with the owners of the steven universe intelectual property. I am simply a fan making fan content as a learning exercise
